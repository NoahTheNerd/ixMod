# No, ixMod does NOT track your data. 
This is for the setting that allows players to track the player & cookie count of their house for charts & stuff.

**The limit of the data is 288 entries, which lasts you 24 hours.**
Feel free to drop full files into the full folder, where it will be ignored. If you want to reset the `data.json` file type `/resethousingtracker`.
(Don't worry if the data.json file is missing, it creates itself if it doesn't exist!)

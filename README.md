## About the project
ixMod is a module for ChatTriggers that provides a better Hypixel Housing experience that isn't all too invasive.

You might've seen jokes about ixMod in the Hypixel Housing community.
These jokes are simply jokes and despite popular belief ixMod isn't the next coming of the flying spaghetti monster :P
